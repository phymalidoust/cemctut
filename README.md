Tutorial for the simulated annealing in the Monte Carlo simulations.

* ### Note

  The tutorial involves formulas. To load them properly and see documments in a rich text form (see all formulas and features) an online interpreter is required. There is a chrome extension that performs this job quite well. Here it is: [MathJax Plugin for Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima?hl=en)
